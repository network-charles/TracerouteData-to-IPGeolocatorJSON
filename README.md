# Traceroute-Data-to-IP-Geolocation-Data

This scipts picks each IPv4 address in the .txt file containing several Traceroute data captured from Google.com

Next, it makes an API call to an IP Geo-locatio API (https://ipgeolocation.io/) to get the Geo-location of the Public Address.

Lastly, these captured API calls are saved into a new file.

I will appreciate it if someone can write a script that converts each API call into an excel spreadsheet. All API call should be saved inside one excel spreadsheet, not several spreadsheets.
